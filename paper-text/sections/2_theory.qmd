# Theory

Economic voting research has long discussed if the economy truly explains voting behaviour, or if the economy is seen through partisan lens [@wlezienEconomicperceptionsvote1997;@lewis-beckDoeseconomicsstill2006; @lewis-beckEconomicspartyvote2008]. Difficult identification challenges emerge from this type of performance models, given that multiple factors are endogenous to the public's perceptions of the economy and vote choice [@andersonendeconomicvoting2007;@kiewietretrospectiveretrospectivevoting1984]. Most retrospective voting research in Latin America has focused on economic voting too, as well as on populism and the recent rise of leftist parties and populism [@bentonDissatisfieddemocratsretrospective2005; @leePartyResponsivenessCollective2014; @wiesehomeierDiscontentleftturn2013a;@murilloElectoralrevolutiondemocratic2010b]. The literature also finds no clear conclusions, with some evidence for Latin American voters behaving similar to developed country voters [@singerArelatinamerican2011]. However, @veigaEconomicvotingage2013 finds that usual macroeconomic variables are not reliable predictors of vote choice on Latin American countries. Regarding leftist parties and populism, evidence has shown that the early 2000's *pink tide* in Latin America may have been a result of retrospective voting and discontent with establishment parties [@wiesehomeierDiscontentleftturn2013a].

The literature on presidential approval is adjacent to economic voting, since it has mostly focused on estimating *popularity functions* to determine the relationship between presidential popularity and other variables [@berlemanneconomicdeterminantspresidential2014]. Macroeconomic variables such as inflation and unemployment have been found to significantly affect presidential approval in some cases, however, no definitive results have been found. Results are highly dependent on context, and on the researcher's choice of variables, model specification, frequency, time frame, among others. [@donovanMotivatedreasoningpublic2020] show that presidential approval is also impacted by the public's partisan identity. Recent findings show that perceptions of corruption can act as significant predictors of presidential approval [@jungDeterminantspresidentialapproval2020], especially in Latin America, where other work has shown a reduced importance of standard economic variables [@cerdaEconomicgrowthpolitical2023]. 

The debate which retrospective voting has gave rise to has incentivized the use of advanced causal inference and experimental techniques to overcome identification challenges. This renewed approach has allowed for a more precise understanding of the mechanisms behind retrospective voting, which involves the evolving literature on the mistakes that voters make when evaluating politicians' performance. This has went beyond the mere lack of knowledge about economic information, which is typically trivial considering that a voter need only consult his own economic situation. Rather, recent research has found that citizens tend to commit errors consistent with decision-making beyond political life. 

Events that are irrelevant are one type of such biases. Though disputed, @achenBlindretrospectionelectoral2017 famously presented evidence of shark attacks impacting Woodrow Wilson's vote share in 1916. Further, @healyIrrelevanteventsaffect2010 find that football games can positively impact the vote share of incumbents, results also consistent with irrelevant events impacting voting behaviour. Events that politicians have no control upon can impact their electoral outcomes if voters are assumed to be affected by mood in their performance judgments, a well-documented phenomenon in other fields. In an experimental setting, @schwarzMoodmisattributionjudgments1983 show how inducing positive moods led subjects to report more feelings of satisfaction relative to subjects which were induced negative moods. Most importantly, it was shown that *people in bad moods were more likely to search for information to explain their mood* relative to those in a happy mood. This is direct evidence for attribution errors: if an outside circumstance induces a negative mood, people may be more likely to attribute their mood to search for information that confirms their mood, rather than the other way around. Additionally, @bowerMoodmemory1981 show that people who were induced a mood were more likely to recall information that was congruent with their mood. This can confirm misattribution errors in voters, who may be more likely to recall negative information about politicians if they are in a bad mood, and vice versa.

Fields other than political science have studied weather extensively, mostly showing significant impacts across a range of variables. Notably, @kellerwarmheartclear2005 find that pleasant weather (higher temperature or barometric pressure) has a positive impact on mood for U.S. subjects. @kampfersunnysidelife2013 and @kampfersunnysidelife2013 find conflicting results of the impact of sunnier days on life satisfaction using survey data from Germany. @lucasDoeslifeseem2013 does not find reliable evidence of weather impacting life satisfaction using U.S. survey data. In Canada, @barrington-leighWeathertransientinfluence2008 finds a positive effect of sunnier days on trust in neighbours using Canadian survey data. Further, @barrington-leighimpactdailyweather2017 find that temporary rainfall variations have a significant, yet small negative impact in life satisfaction, especially for individuals with poor health and women. @lignierDoesclimateimpact2023 find that higher temperatures in prolonged dry temperatures have a negative impact on life satisfaction in Australia. Beyond life satisfaction, @dellereffectweathersubjective2022 show that cloudy days have a significant impact on the way that managers evaluate subordinates across field experiments in the United States. Additionally, @quijano-ruizAssessingreliabilityselfrated2023, using the same CPC daily weather data for Ecuador, finds an effect of daily temperature changes on self-rated health for female survey respondents only. 

The causal mechanism this paper draws from @schwarzMoodmisattributionjudgments1983 and @bowerMoodmemory1981. Weather impacts mood, which then causes citizens to attribute their moods to external circumstances. If citizens consider higher temperatures to be "bad weather", their mood can be negatively impacted, making them more likely to negatively evaluate the president as a result of their discomfort. According to the theory, voters will attribute their mood to a external situation (the question being asked by the interviewer) and may even justify it by searching for negative events that confirm their mood, as proposed by @bowerMoodmemory1981.

In summary, retrospective voting literature has had an economic focus, which underscores the importance of controlling for economic perceptions in any formal empirical model of political behaviour. The Latin American context has shown some degree of resemblance to developed countries, but also some differences, notably in how certain ideological factors may moderate political behaviour to larger extent than developed countries. Presidential approval rating is extensive and has provided many recommendations for the estimation of popularity functions, notably, incorporating data at many frequencies and aggregations. However, this may not be possible or applicable in all contexts due to data availability. My theory on the impact of weather on presidential approval is supported by a growing literature on the impact of weather on mood and life satisfaction, which has shown mostly significant impacts of "better" weather across several variables. The causal mechanism I draw from is supported by psychological theory, which has shown that mood can impact the way that individuals process information, and how they attribute their mood to external circumstances.
