# Empirical Strategy

My data are composed of a pooled cross section of the AmericasBarometer (AB) [@ABDatasets] merged with daily CPC Global Unified temperature [@NOAADatasets] based on interview date and canton in Ecuador. The AB is a public opinion survey conducted by the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP), which has conducted biyearly survey waves in Ecuador and other countries from 2004 to 2023. I use the subscriber LAPOP datasets available through Universidad San Francisco de Quito's research affiliation with LAPOP, focusing on the eight survey waves carried out between 2008 to 2023[^1]. The surveys are based on a multi-stage national probability design, representative at the national level, except for 2021, where the survey switched to a random-digit-dialing design due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
