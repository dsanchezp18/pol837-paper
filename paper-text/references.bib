  abstract = {Laws in most Western European countries give workers strong job rights, including the right to advance notice of layoff and the right to severance pay or other compensation if laid off. Many of these same countries also encourage hours adjustment in lieu of layoffs by providing prorated unemployment compensation to workers on reduced hours. This paper compares the adjustment of manufacturing employment and hours in West Germany, France and Belgium, three countries with strong job security regulations and well-established short-time compensation systems, with that in the United States. Although the adjustment of employment to changes in output is much slower in the German, French and Belgian manufacturing sectors than in U.S. manufacturing, the adjustment of total hours worked is much more similar. The short-time system makes a significant contribution to observed adjustment in all three European countries. In addition, we find little evidence that the weakening of job security regulations that occurred in Germany, France and Belgium during the 1980s affected employers' adjustment to changes in output. These findings suggest that. given appropriate supporting institutions. strong job security need not inhibit employer adjustment to changing conditions.},

Using data from a panel of eligible voters in Williamsburg-James City County, Virginia, three models of attitude consistency are tested: rational voting, selective perception, and persuasion. Rational voting is defined as choosing a candidate on the basis of issue positions. The debate increased voter awareness of Ford's and Carter's positions on the issue of unemployment, one of the key issues in the debate. However, there is no evidence of changes in candidate preference based on this issue. There is strong evidence of persuasion: voters adopted the position taken by their preferred candidate.},

Our discussion of employment and unemployment largely deals with the effect of employment protection on levels of these outcome indicators. We distinguish between overall and compositional effects (e.g., by demographic group and type of contract), between developing and industrialized nations, and identify some key control variables. Our discussion of labor market dynamics focuses on the speed of adjustment issue and on gross flows. It also formalizes the link between analyses of levels of and changes in variables.

Holding tenure in office constant, differences in performance by reelection-eligible and term-limited incumbents identify an accountability effect: reelection-eligible governors have greater incentives to exert costly effort on behalf of voters. Holding term-limit status constant, differences in performance by incumbents in different terms identify a competence effect: later-term incumbents are more likely to be competent both because they have survived reelection and because they have experience in office. We show that economic growth is higher and taxes, spending, and borrowing costs are lower under reelection-eligible incumbents than under term-limited incumbents (accountability), and under reelected incumbents than under first-term incumbents (competence), all else equal. In addition to improving our understanding of the role of elections in representative democracy, these findings resolve an empirical puzzle about the disappearance of the effect of term limits on gubernatorial performance over time.},

  abstract = {On December 22, 2017, President Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the most sweeping revision of US tax law since the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The law introduced many  significant changes. However, perhaps none was as important as the changes in the treatment of traditional "C" corporations‚Äîthose corporations subject to a separate corporate income tax.  Beginning in 2018, the federal corporate tax rate fell from 35 percent to 21 percent, some investment qualified for immediate deduction as an expense, and multinational corporations faced a  substantially modified treatment of their activities. This paper seeks to evaluate the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to understand its effects on resource allocation and distribution. It  compares US corporate tax rates to other countries before the 2017 tax law, and describes ways in which the US corporate sector has evolved that are especially relevant to tax policy. The  discussion then turns the main changes of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 for the corporate income tax. A range of estimates suggests that the law is likely to contribute to increased US capital  investment and, through that, an increase in US wages. The magnitude of these increases is extremely difficult to predict. Indeed, the public debate about the benefits of the new corporate tax  provisions enacted (and the alternatives not adopted) has highlighted the limitations of standard approaches in distributional analysis to assigning corporate tax burdens.},

We also show that the optimal level of employment protection depends on other labour market features, such as the bargaining power of workers and the existence of wage rigidities like the minimum wage.},

While about half of all studies for the United States find a significant effect of unemployment and inflation on presidential popularity, the others do not. Additional economic issues have rarely been studied. In this survey article we study the likely causes for the inconclusive findings. While various factors have an influence on the results, especially the choice of the sample period is of crucial importance. While in the very long run we find unemployment and inflation to have a robust effect on presidential approval, this holds not true for shorter sub-periods. This result might indicate that the popularity function is instable over time. However, the findings might also be taken as an indication that the most often employed linear estimation approach is inadequate. Further research on these issues is necessary.},

We hope that this introductory essay and the three papers that follow will stimulate interest in this subject. This introductory essay first describes some of the basic economic tradeoffs involved in intellectual property law, and then describes the framework of the law in the six areas described above: patent, copyright, semiconductor protection, trademark, trade secret, and misappropriation. It is intended both to provide thumbnail descriptions of the various intellectual property regimes to economists working in this area and to indicate where additional economic research might be useful.},

Because voters think in terms of categories defined by the ideological center, their behavior deviates from standard models of utility maximization along ideological continua. Their preferences are characterized by discontinuities, rewarding parties on their side of the ideological space more than existing spatial models would predict. While this study concurs with prior studies suggesting that voters tend to use a proximity rule, it argues that this rule mainly serves to distinguish among parties of the same side. Overall, the results suggest that voters‚Äô party evaluations are characterized by a nontrivial identity component, generating in-group biases not captured by the existing spatial models of voting.},

The legislators sometimes stated their issue positions in these letters, sometimes supported by extensive arguments but sometimes minimally justified; in many cases, these issue positions were at odds with voters‚Äô. An ostensibly unrelated survey found that voters often adopted the positions legislators took, even when legislators offered little justification. Moreover, voters did not evaluate their legislators more negatively when representatives took positions these voters had previously opposed, again regardless of whether legislators provided justifications. The findings are consistent with theories suggesting voters often defer to politicians‚Äô policy judgments.},

The experiments also measure the extent to which people think about policy. Contrary to many accounts, they suggest that party cues do not inhibit such thinking. This is not cause for unbridled optimism about citizens' ability to make good decisions, but it is reason to be more sanguine about their ability to use information about policy when they have it.},

We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered DiD setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identification results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our proposed tools by analyzing the effect of the minimum wage on teen employment from 2001‚Äì2007. Open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methods.},

Our empirical analysis shows that the one economic variable that appears consistently in all estimates is economic growth. More specifically, we show that for each point of additional growth, the approval rating increases between 1.1 and 1.9 percentage points. Other variables, such as inflation, government spending, and the composition of spending, are significant in only some of the specifications used, while growth is remarkably robust in all of them. Among non-economic variables, the lack of solid institutions also appears consistently as significant as well as the lagged value of government approval ratings. These results suggest that a program focused on growth has a positive influence on the popularity of the government. This conclusion is particularly relevant in a region where populism has been remarkably persistent over time and where the norm has been to run large budget deficits to gain popular support, with consequences on inflation and the external accounts.},

It is shown that the ordering of alternatives may be characterized by a utility function, where utility is represented by a vector with real-valued components, such vectors being ordered lexicographically (like the words in a dictionary). If an axiom permitting comparison of intensities of preference is admitted, such a utility index must be unique up to transformations (such as proportionality transformations) preserving group operations. A purely topological axiom, called the Axiom of Substitution, is shown to imply that utility is real-valued (i.e., that the above vector has only one component).},

Ordered logistic regressions of party evaluations under proximity, directional, and mixed models reveal that the classic spatial model and the directional model perform equally well.

The proximity model works better for voter evaluations of governing parties while the directional model works well for opposition parties.},

These hypotheses are tested using experimental data gathered on the opinions of adults and college students toward two policy issues‚Äîthe management of urban growth and the right of an extremist group to conduct a rally. Our results indicate that framing effects depend more heavily on the qualities of frames than on their frequency of dissemination and that competition alters but does not eliminate the influence of framing.

This paper uses a recent large-scale British survey to document the extent of this gender differential for eight measures of job satisfaction and to evaluate the proposition that identical men and women in identical jobs should be equally satisfied. Neither the different jobs that men and women do, their different work values, nor sample selection account for the gender satisfaction differential. The paper's proposed explanation appeals to the notion of relative well-being, especially relative to workers' expectations. An identical man and woman with the same jobs and expectations would indeed report identical job satisfaction, but women's expectations are argued to be lower than men's. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that the gender satisfaction differential disappears for the young, the higher-educated, professionals and those in male-dominated workplaces, for all of whom there is less likely to be a gender difference in job expectations.},

We use an experiment to test if weather introduces a directional bias to subjective evaluations and if weather interacts with a decision bias documented by prior literature: spillover from performance on an objective measure to the subjective evaluation of an unrelated performance dimension. In contrast to conventional wisdom, we find no evidence that sunny weather results in more positive evaluations. However, we find evidence that cloudy weather mitigates spillover effects in subjective evaluations. Specifically, we find that spillover effects are significantly less pronounced on cloudy days vis-√†-vis sunny days in geographic locations where the weather is more likely to influence evaluators. Moreover, we find that, at least in our study, sunshine is a necessary condition for the spillover effect first documented by Bol and Smith (2011). We examine and rule out various channels through which weather may affect the spillover effect, concluding that our results are most likely attributable to cloudy weather inducing a more detailed and systematic cognitive processing style.},

The data are based on surveys of business people in the countries covered, so the indices we use are subjective in nature. Controlling for country and time fixed effects, and using dynamic panel data techniques, we find evidence that increasing the flexibility of the labor market increases both the employment rate and the rate of participation in the labor force. A conservative estimate suggests that if France were to make its labor markets as flexible as those in the US, its employment rate would increase 1.6 percentage points, or 14\% of the employment gap between the two countries. The estimated effects are larger in the female than in the male labor market, although both groups seem to have similar long-run coefficients. There is also some evidence that more flexibility leads to lower unemployment rates and to lower rates of long-term unemployment. We also find evidence consistent with the hypothesis that inflexible labor markets produce ‚Äújobless recoveries‚Äù and introduce more unemployment persistence.},

An important question, then, is what shapes citizens‚Äô approval of the executive. A large body of literature demonstrates that the president‚Äôs handling of issues, particularly the economy, is an important component. A similarly large literature confirms that evaluations of the president, like most political objects, are filtered through partisan lenses. Due to changes in the US political environment in the last few decades, we suspect that the relative importance of these components has changed over time. In particular, we argue that polarization has increased partisan motivated reasoning when it comes to evaluations of the president. We support this empirically by disaggregating approval ratings from Reagan to Obama into in- and out-partisans, finding that approval is increasingly detached from economic assessments. This is true for members opposite the president‚Äôs party earlier than it is for in-partisans. While the president has been over-attributed credit and blame for economic conditions, the increasing impact of partisanship on approval at the expense of economic sentiment has generally negative implications when it comes to electoral outcomes and democratic accountability.},

To investigate relationships between the two, we first extracted audio features from dance music using the Spotify API and compared those features with a baseline dataset that is considered to represent music in general. Analyses revealed that, compared to the baseline, the dance music dataset had significantly higher levels of energy, danceability, valence, and loudness, and lower speechiness, instrumentalness and acousticness. Second, to identify potential subgroups of dance music, a cluster analysis was performed on its Spotify audio features. Results of this cluster analysis suggested five subgroups of dance music with varying combinations of Spotify audio features: ‚Äúfast-lyrical‚Äù, ‚Äúsad-instrumental‚Äù, ‚Äúsoft-acoustic‚Äù, ‚Äúsad-energy‚Äù, and ‚Äúhappy-energy‚Äù. Third, a factor analysis revealed three main RL categories: ‚Äúachieving self-awareness‚Äù, ‚Äúregulation of arousal and mood‚Äù, and ‚Äúexpression of social relatedness‚Äù. Finally, we identified variations in people‚Äôs RL ratings for each subgroup of dance music. This suggests that certain characteristics of dance music are more suitable for listeners‚Äô particular RL, which shape their music preferences. Importantly, the highest-rated RL items for dance music belonged to the ‚Äúregulation of mood and arousal‚Äù category. This might be interpreted as the main function of dance music. We hope that future research will elaborate on connections between musical qualities of dance music and particular music listening functions.},

Traditional statistical techniques, such as analysis of variance which applies the ordinary least squares principle to estimate the coefficients of the linear model, have been found untenable in well specified situations when the dependent variable is a proportion. A transformation of the proportion, the logits, extends the range of valid analysis. This technique is used to test, for the British elections, and additive model of electoral choice (composed of sex, class and age) by examining the residuals, i.e. the difference between the observed and fitted logits. The model fitted to the 1970 election suggested interaction effects, particularly between sex and class. Both statistical significance and substantive meaning were employed to determine the effects included in the final model of voting choice.}

The results suggest that incumbent workers protected by advance notice and severance pay laws were able to extract higher wages than were incumbent workers unprotected by such laws. There is evidence, however, that the ultimate wage effect differed by workers' union status: starting wages of nonunion workers appear to have fallen to offset the subsequent wage increase, indicating that nonunion workers may "pay for" advance notice and severance pay laws, whereas union workers who were protected by such laws seem to have been able to exploit their bargaining position to increase their lifetime earnings.},

This result has a very practical consequence: according to the directional theory, a centrist party cannot expect to receive strong electoral support. Thus, in the practice of politics, the directional theory means conflict, not consensus. In their analyses, Rabinowitz, Macdonald and Listhaug use the mean of all the respondents' party placement (a constant) as a proxy for the party's position. However, using a more adequate analysis, where the party position along a scale varies between the respondents (i.e. is a variable), the results become different. The directional theory is not without its merits as a new theory of issue voting. Nevertheless, the old proximity theory is still the most powerful theory within electoral research.},

Scandals, recessions, and landslide elections do not greatly affect party identification; large shifts in party attachments occur only when the social imagery of a party changes, as when African Americans became part of the Democratic Party in the South after the passage of the Voting Rights Act. Drawing on a wealth of data analysis using individual-level and aggregate survey data from the United States and abroad, this study offers a new perspective on party identification that will set the terms of discussion for years to come.},

During the late 1960s, the growth in research and development (R\&D) investment slowed down markedly (in constant dollars) and did not really recover until the late 1970s. Basic research was especially hard hit, showing a substantial absolute decline during the same period. Whether this slowdown in the investment in new technologies can account for the observed productivity slowdown is a fascinating question. I shall argue below that it cannot, at least not yet, since its effects take a long time to work themselves through the innovation and diffusion processes. The oil price hikes of the early and late 1970s and their macro-consequences are, therefore, the most likely direct causes of these pervasive declines in the growth rate of productivity.},

To do this, I exploit an exogenous reform in UK R\&D tax policy, which changed the definition of an SME from firms with fewer than 250 employees to those with fewer than 500 employees. I use the UK Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey (BERD), for which companies do not have an incentive to relabel their ordinary employees or spending as R\&D. I find that R\&D tax incentives help to increase R\&D spending at the company level; this translates to a user cost elasticity between ‚àí0.88 and ‚àí1.18. Further, the additional R\&D generated through the tax relief can be attributed entirely to an increase in the number of R\&D employees in the companies‚Äô workforce. Together, these results challenge a common narrative on the role of R\&D tax incentives.},

The principal source of information used in this endeavour is the Statistics Canada Survey of Innovation 1999. The paper starts with an overview of other studies that looked at the use of intellectual property rights in Canada. Follows a conceptual framework presenting variables likely to explain the use specific IPRs by Canadian manufacturing firms. The use of IPRs is to a great extent correlated with basic economic characteristics of firms, their activities and industry environment. A series of estimated logit regressions predict the probability that a firm will use a specific IPR instrument. Also estimated is the contribution of the use of IPRs to the probability that a firm innovates. The decision of a firm to use IPRs is often not independent of the decision to innovate. To eliminate the potential endogeneity bias I estimate a two-stage logit model. A comparison of the single- and two-stage logit models shows that the nexus from the protection of intellectual property (patents) to innovation may be weaker than indicated by the single equation model.},

  abstract = {Does information irrelevant to government performance affect voting behavior? If so, how does this help us understand the mechanisms underlying voters' retrospective assessments of candidates' performance in office? To precisely test for the effects of irrelevant information, we explore the electoral impact of local college football games just before an election, irrelevant events that government has nothing to do with and for which no government response would be expected. We find that a win in the 10 d before Election Day causes the incumbent to receive an additional 1.61 percentage points of the vote in Senate, gubernatorial, and presidential elections, with the effect being larger for teams with stronger fan support. In addition to conducting placebo tests based on postelection games, we demonstrate these effects by using the betting market's estimate of a team's probability of winning the game before it occurs to isolate the surprise component of game outcomes. We corroborate these aggregate-level results with a survey that we conducted during the 2009 NCAA men's college basketball tournament, where we find that surprising wins and losses affect presidential approval. An experiment embedded within the survey also indicates that personal well-being may influence voting decisions on a subconscious level. We find that making people more aware of the reasons for their current state of mind reduces the effect that irrelevant events have on their opinions. These findings underscore the subtle power of irrelevant events in shaping important real-world decisions and suggest ways in which decision making can be improved.},

As a whole, the recent literature provides a more complete and nuanced picture of the retrospective voter as sometimes, but not always, effectively incentivizing elected officials to enhance public welfare. Leveraging examples of retrospective voting in areas other than the economy, the field is heading toward a middle ground in which voters resemble decision makers in many other domains. In many cases, a coherent logic governs voters' choices. In other instances, voters make mistakes, often in predictable ways subject to well-known psychological biases. Understanding the circumstances under which retrospective voting achieves effective democratic accountability and when it fails to do so is an important task for subsequent research. We discuss two additional issues for future exploration: a better understanding of normative benchmarks, and increased attention to the relationship between retrospective voting behavior and policy outcomes.},

Important features of the research design include the use of individual fixed effects models as well as the inclusion of country-specific trends in the dependent variable. A robust finding is that policies making it easier to create temporary jobs on average raise the likelihood that wage and salary workers will be in temporary jobs. This effect is felt primarily when the regional unemployment rate is relatively high. However, there is no evidence that such reforms raise employment. Thus, these reforms, while touted as a way of jump-starting individuals' careers in the job market, appear rather to encourage a substitution of temporary for permanent work.},

The answers that have been obtained, however, are only partial and limited, as each of these approaches entails serious problems of estimation and interpretation. Further progress in this area, we argue, requires explicit treatment of conceptual and statistical issues that have hindered previous research: the dynamic formulation of expectations and preferences, the incidence of policy (and nonpolicy) effects across the population, and notions of incumbency and political responsibility.},

  abstract = {Research on the effect of employment protection legislation (EPL) on unemployment is extensive. However, results are ambiguous and were not able to show a clear pattern of how EPL is affecting labour market outcomes. Recent research has focussed on the effect of EPL on youth unemployment, linking higher protection to higher unemployment among young labour market entrants compared to their adult peers. Moreover, it is argued that EPL might not have a universal effect on youth unemployment but must be considered in an interplay of institutional factors, including vocational specificity. Based on these findings, this thesis provides a comprehensive assessment of the effects of EPL and vocational specificity on the labour market chances of young people compared to adults. As young people in particular often find their way into the labour market via temporary contracts, it is distinguished between EPL for regular and temporary contracts. A total of 28 OECD countries are examined from 1985 to 2013 using OECD data. In line with previous research, there appear to be no main effects of regular EPL or the vocational specificity on its own on the level of youth unemployment or the youth-to-adult unemployment ratio, but there is a positive effect of temporary EPL on the youth-to-adult ratio. This suggests that especially for young people deregulation of these contracts ‚Äì contrary to the usual theoretical assumptions ‚Äì can have a positive effect on their labour market situation.

Using spatial econometrics techniques for panel data to answer the first question, we find evidence for strategic interaction in tax holidays, in addition to the well-known competition over the corporate income tax rate. We find no evidence, however, for competition over investment allowances and tax credits. Using dynamic panel data econometrics to answer the second question, we find evidence that lower corporate income tax rates and longer tax holidays are effective in attracting FDI, but not in boosting gross private fixed capital formation or growth.},

  abstract = {Enthusiasm for ‚Äúgreening the financial system‚Äù is welcome, but a fundamental challenge remains: financial decision makers lack the necessary information. It is not enough to know that climate change is bad. Markets need credible, digestible information on how climate change translates into material risks. To bridge the gap between climate science and real-world financial indicators, we simulate the effect of climate change on sovereign credit ratings for 109 countries, creating the world‚Äôs first climate-adjusted sovereign credit rating. Under various warming scenarios, we find evidence of climate-induced sovereign downgrades as early as 2030, increasing in intensity and across more countries over the century. We find strong evidence that stringent climate policy consistent with limiting warming to below 2\,¬∞C, honoring the Paris Climate Agreement and following representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6, could nearly eliminate the effect of climate change on ratings. In contrast, under higher emissions scenarios (i.e., RCP 8.5), 59 sovereigns experience climate-induced downgrades by 2030, with an average reduction of 0.68 notches, rising to 81 sovereigns facing an average downgrade of 2.18 notches by 2100. We calculate the effect of climate-induced sovereign downgrades on the cost of corporate and sovereign debt. Across the sample, climate change could increase the annual interest payments on sovereign debt by US\$45‚Äì\$67 billion under RCP 2.6, rising to US\$135‚Äì\$203 billion under RCP 8.5. The additional cost to corporations is US\$10‚Äì\$17 billion under RCP 2.6 and US\$35‚Äì\$61 billion under RCP 8.5.

We exploit the fact that this reform increased unjust dismissal costs for businesses below 15 employees, while leaving dismissal costs unchanged for bigger businesses, to set up a natural experiment research design. We find that the increase in dismissal costs decreased accessions and separations for workers in small relative to large firms, especially in sectors with higher employment volatility, with a negligible impact on net employment. We also find some evidence suggesting that the reform reduced firms' entry rates and employment adjustments, but had no effect on exit rates.},

Unjust‚Äêdismissal provisions in U.S. states reduce the re‚Äêemployment probabilities of unemployed workers relative to employed workers.

Using several individual surveys, we obtain positive and significant effects of EPL on stress in high-turnover sectors relative to low-turnover sectors, with causal interpretation. As to the net effect of EPL, it raises workers‚Äô stress in high-turnover sectors while it generally reduces it in lower-turnover sectors.},

Second, the causal modeling is based on debatable assumptions that could be behind these surprising results. Third, in the United Kingdom and the United States, evidence suggests that national economic perceptions reflect closely the real economy. There may well be an endogeneity problem in economic voting studies, but it more likely runs from economic perceptions to partisanship, rather than vice versa. Panel studies, available for both the United Kingdom and the United States in national election surveys, offer ideal databases for testing these rival claims in the future. Great care must be given to exogenize properly the partisanship variable.},

Recently, a revisionist view has arisen, contending that this link, regularly observed in election surveys, is mostly spurious. According to the argument, partisanship distorts economic perception, thereby substantially exaggerating the real vote connection. These causality issues have not been much investigated empirically, despite their critical importance. Utilizing primarily American, and secondarily British and Canadian, election panel surveys, we confront directly questions of the time dynamic and independent variable exogeneity. We find, after all, economics clearly matters for the vote. Indeed, once these causality concerns are properly taken into account, the impact of economic perceptions emerges as larger than previously thought. As well, the actual impact of partisanship is clearly reduced.},

In a short-run analysis, we find that the number of online contributions to the Democratic Party increases in response to higher weekly temperature, with a larger effect in counties with more anti-environment incumbent politicians. In a medium-run analysis, we find that, when a natural disaster strikes, the election becomes more competitive if the incumbent leans more anti-environment: total campaign contributions increase for both candidates and the increase is skewed toward the challenger, the race is more likely to be contested, and the incumbent is less likely to be re-elected. These results suggest that extreme weather events carry a moderate electoral penalty for anti-environment incumbents during 1990‚Äì2012. This mechanism will likely play a more important role as the public awareness of climate change continues to increase.},

The data collection is unique in providing extensive information on the issue positions of all parties with potential for achieving representation in the parliament. Results suggest that the directional theory provides a better description of the relationship. Consistent with directional theory, we find that when parties occupy a centrist position on an issue they are not evaluated on the basis of that issue. Voters neither love nor hate a party in the middle. Thus, in order to build support on the basis of issues, parties must offer some strong stands.},

  abstract = {In Canada, as in many other countries that have adopted R\&D tax credits and allowances, there has been considerable controversy over their effectiveness in increasing company-financed research and development. This study seems to be one of the first systematic attempts to estimate the effects of Canada's R\&D tax credits and allowances. The results present a very consistent picture. The survey results, the econometric results, and some simple calculations based on rough measures of the price elasticity of demand for R\&D all suggest that the special research allowance increased R\&D expenditures by about 1 percent and that the investment tax credit increased them by about 2 percent. These increases seem to be appreciably less than the revenue losses to the government.}

Although Kenney is understandably concerned about the chilling effect Ottawa has had on energy investment, government is ill-suited for corporate management. To offset harmful federal policies, it would be wiser and more efficient to use targeted tax breaks and regulatory relief at the provincial level.In response to the recent abandonment of a \$20 billion oilsands project, in his speech {$<$}a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/business/energy/do-what-is-necessary-kenney-hints-at-investment-in-major-oil-and-gas-project"{$>$}Kenney reminded listeners{$<$}/a{$>$} of the Alberta Energy Company (AEC), a Crown investment firm that ({$<$}a href="https://digital.library.mcgill.ca/hrcorpreports/pdfs/A/Alberta\_Energy\_Co\_Ltd\_1977.pdf"{$>$}by 1975{$<$}/a{$>$}) was owned 50/50 between public shareholders and the province of Alberta. The AEC was spearheaded by then-premier Peter Lougheed {$<$}a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/sept-18-1973-green-light-for-syncrude-biggest-project-in-alberta-history"{$>$}who reportedly{$<$}/a{$>$} didn‚Äôt believe his support for (partial) government ownership in an energy company was ‚Äúa denial of his free enterprise philosophy.‚ÄùFor Kenney‚Äôs part, he too argues that if the province of Alberta were to revive the legacy of ‚Äúan agency or corporation similar to the AEC in the 1970s,‚Äù that this would merely be to offset the uncertain regulations ‚Äúand frankly hostile policy-setting from Ottawa.‚ÄùKenney‚Äôs worries are completely legitimate: Besides the federal carbon tax, federal {$<$}a href="https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/BillDetails.aspx?Language=E\&amp;billId=9630600"{$>$}Bill C-69{$<$}/a{$>$} and {$<$}a href="https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/BillDetails.aspx?billId=8936657\&amp;Language=E"{$>$}Bill C-48{$<$}/a{$>$}, passed into law last year, present real barriers to energy development in western Canada, through a tightened (but more political and uncertain) environmental review process and a restriction on large oil tankers‚Äô ability to take exports from the British Columbia coast. Tighter federal standards on methane and ethanol are other examples of Ottawa‚Äôs ‚Äúhostile‚Äù policy.Although these policies were justified by concerns over climate change, Premier Kenney is right that these federal moves have hindered energy development. This is economically damaging because it makes electricity and transportation more expensive for consumers, and also negatively impacts the workers who would have been hired in new development projects but are now not needed.Even so, the proposal to have the Alberta government itself invest in energy projects (or to give backstop guarantees to private investors) is a very blunt instrument, which might end up causing Albertan taxpayers a double whammy. If federal policies cause private investors to pull out of an energy project in Alberta, it‚Äôs because they think that Ottawa‚Äôs decisions have made the project not worth the risk.If now the provincial government effectively forces taxpayers to invest in the project, that decision doesn‚Äôt magically render the project a good risk after all. It merely means that taxpayers are implicitly having their money sunk into a project that professional investors have decided isn‚Äôt worth it.Rather than the government becoming a hedge fund, it would make more sense to engage in targeted tax and regulatory relief. For example, Alberta could waive any provincial-level taxes‚Äîincluding an {$<$}a href="https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/reforming-capital-gains-taxes-in-alberta"{$>$}offset to the federal capital gains tax{$<$}/a{$>$}‚Äîfor those companies deemed to have been unduly harmed by Ottawa. This would still ‚Äúinvest‚Äù the forfeited potential tax revenue, while retain the advantages of private investors making business decisions with their own funds on the line. The province could continue the {$<$}a href="https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/evaluating-albertas-energy-regulator"{$>$}reform of the Alberta Energy Regulator{$<$}/a{$>$} so that developers can be certain of the rules.Premier Kenney is right to want to offset harmful Ottawa policies, but provincial ownership of energy companies is a dubious proposal. It would be wiser and more efficient to target tax and regulatory relief to offset federal burdens.},

  abstract = {The disagreement among studies on the employment effects of minimum wages in the United States is well known. Less well known, and more puzzling, is the absence of agreement on what the research literature says‚Äîthat is, how economists summarize the body of evidence on the employment effects of minimum wages. Summaries range from ‚Äúit is now well established that higher minimum wages do not reduce employment,‚Äù to ‚Äúthe evidence is very mixed with effects centered on zero so there is no basis for a strong conclusion one way or the other,‚Äù to ‚Äúmost evidence points to adverse employment effects.‚Äù We explore the question of what conclusions can be drawn from the literature, focusing on the evidence using subnational minimum wage variation within the United States that has dominated the research landscape since the early 1990s. To accomplish this, we assembled the entire set of published studies in this literature and identified the core estimates that support the conclusions from each study, in most cases relying on responses from the researchers who wrote these papers. Our key conclusions are as follows: (i) there is a clear preponderance of negative estimates in the literature; (ii) this evidence is stronger for teens and young adults and the less educated; (iii) the evidence from studies of directly affected workers points even more strongly to negative employment effects; and (iv) the evidence from studies of low-wage industries is less one-sided.},

The American Political Science Review 64 (1), 18‚Äì34.] pioneering study, students of presidential approval ratings have agreed that major events affect these ratings. Despite this consensus, there is wide divergence in the ways that scholars have selected events for inclusion in models of approval ratings. This inconsistency inhibits direct comparisons across studies and raises the possibility that results are contingent on those selection criteria. Thus, what we have learned about the impact of various factors that may affect approval may depend on the details of selection criteria. Practically, scholars analyzing presidential approval ratings for any theoretical purpose must construct a list of events themselves, which takes considerable time. We propose a set of selection criteria and construct a list of events from 1953 to 2006 that scholars can employ. We also demonstrate that the list of events generates empirical results that comport with extant findings in the presidential approval literature.},

Among the issues discussed in this paper are the length of protection for intellectual property, the rules that allow considerable copying of intellectual property without permission of the originator, the rules governing derivative works, and alternative methods of providing incentives for the creation of intellectual property. The emphasis is on copyright law, which, perhaps because of its complex legal structure and the relative neglect by economists of the arts and entertainment, has tended to be slighted in the conventional economic analysis of intellectual property, relative to patent law, where economic analysis can draw on an extensive literature concerning the economics of innovation.

Yet fully a quarter century later, that theory remains the dominant paradigm for understanding mass-elite linkage in politics. We present an alternative spatial theory of elections that we argue has greater empirical verisimilitude. Based on the ideas of symbolic politics, the directional theory assumes that most people have a diffuse preference for a certain direction of policy-making and that people vary in the intensity with which they hold those preferences. We test the two competing theories at the individual level with National Election Study data and find the directional theory more strongly supported than the traditional spatial theory. We then develop the implications of the directional theory for candidate behavior and assess the predictions in light of evidence from the U.S. Congress.},

The conclusion is that, overall, Canadians tend to export more to those countries where their patent rights are highly safeguarded. Stronger patent protection induces Canadians to export relatively more to high-income countries than to low-income countries. In addition, the effect of stronger patent rights is to increase exports to those countries that pose a strong threat of imitation and to reduce exports to those countries that pose the weakest threat of imitation.

A standard model of heterogenous producers, amended to include a channel for innovation, is calibrated to the U.S. to serve as a benchmark. Canadian specific features that affect innovation spending, namely tax/subsidy policy, regulatory burden and innovation costs are applied to this benchmark, together and in isolation, to quantify their importance. When applied together, the model replicates many aspects of the Canadian economy and predicts lower innovation spending, average firm size and productivity, closely in line with the evidence. Differences in innovation costs account for the majority of firm size and productivity differences, while fairly modest differences in regulatory burden translate to sizeable aggregate losses because they alter incentives to innovate. Subsidies to innovation have subdued effects due to higher innovation costs and regulatory burden, but imply larger productivity differences if absent.},

  abstract = {Unhealthy persons are more likely to lose their jobs than those who are healthy but whether this is affected by recession is unclear. We asked how healthy and unhealthy persons fared in labour markets during Europe's 2008‚Äì2010 recessions and whether national differences in employment protection helped mitigate any relative disadvantage experienced by those in poor health. Two retrospective cohorts of persons employed at baseline were constructed from the European Statistics of Income and Living Conditions in 26 EU countries. The first comprised individuals followed between 2006 and 2008, n~=~46,085 (pre-recession) and the second between 2008 and 2010, n~=~85,786 (during recession). We used multi-level (individual- and country-fixed effects) logistic regression models to assess the relationship (overall and disaggregated by gender) between recessions, unemployment, and health status, as well as any modifying effect of OECD employment protection indices measuring the strength of policies against dismissal and redundancy. Those with chronic illnesses and health limitations were disproportionately affected by the recession, respectively with a 1.5- and 2.5-fold greater risk of unemployment than healthy people during 2008‚Äì2010. During severe recessions ({$>$}7\% fall in GDP), employment protections did not mitigate the risk of job loss (OR~=~1.06, 95\% CI: 0.94‚Äì1.21). However, in countries experiencing milder recessions ({$<$}7\% fall in GDP), each additional unit of employment protection reduced job loss risk (OR~=~0.72, 95\% CI: 0.58‚Äì0.90). Before the recession, women with severe health limitations especially benefited, with additional reductions of 22\% for each unit of employment protection (AORfemale~=~0.78, 95\% CI: 0.62‚Äì0.97), such that at high levels the difference in the risk of job loss between healthy and unhealthy women disappeared. Employment protection policies may counteract labour market inequalities between healthy and unhealthy people, but additional programmes are likely needed to protect vulnerable groups during severe recessions.},

In both experiments, Ss reported more happiness and satisfaction with their life as a whole when in a good mood than when in a bad mood. However, the negative impact of bad moods was eliminated when Ss were induced to attribute their present feelings to transient external sources irrelevant to the evaluation of their lives; but Ss who were in a good mood were not affected by misattribution manipulations. The data suggest that (a) people use their momentary affective states in making judgments of how happy and satisfied they are with their lives in general and (b) people in unpleasant affective states are more likely to search for and use information to explain their state than are people in pleasant affective states.

Controlling for a number of individual and firm characteristics, we investigate the relationship between worker‚Äôs absences which act as a proxy for employee shirking and local unemployment rate (at the provincial level). We find a strong negative association between unemployment and absenteeism rate, larger in magnitude in small firms due presumably to a significantly lower protection from dismissals in these firms. As an indirect test of the role of unemployment as worker discipline device, we show that public sector employees, almost impossible to fire, do not react to the local unemployment.},

This increase to the minimum wage was the first in nearly a decade and was approved with the objective of alleviating poverty among low-income households. However, a higher minimum wage may result in more unemployment and poverty. We exploit time-series variation in minimum wages set by Canadian provinces between 1981 and 2004. OLS and IV results suggest that a 10\% increase in the minimum wage is significantly correlated with a 3\%‚Äì5\% drop in teen employment. Further, a 10\% rise in the minimum wage is also significantly associated with a 4\%‚Äì6\% increase in the percentage of families living under Low Income Cut Offs (LICOs). Difference-in-difference estimates from the 1993, 1995, and 1998 waves of the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) support these findings as they suggest that income earned by teens constitutes a non-trivial portion of household income for families beneath Low Income Cut Offs. Therefore, a higher minimum wage may paradoxically result in a significant negative shock to household income among low-income families.},

In 2014, states spent between 5 USD and 216 USD per capita on incentives  for firms in the form of firm-specific subsidies and general tax credits, which mostly target investment, job creation, and research and development. States with higher  per capita incentives tend to have higher state corporate tax rates. Recipients of firm-specific incentives are usually large establishments in manufacturing, technology,  and high-skilled service industries, and the average discretionary subsidy is 178M USD for 1,500 promised jobs. Firms tend to accept subsidy deals from places that are  richer, larger, and more urban than the average county, and poor places provide larger incentives and spend more per job. Comparing winning and runner-up locations  for each deal, we find that average employment within the three-digit industry of the deal increases by roughly 1,500 jobs. While we find some evidence of direct  employment gains from attracting a firm, we do not find strong evidence that firm-specific tax incentives increase broader economic growth at the state and local level.},

  abstract = {To estimate the dynamic effects of an absorbing treatment, researchers often use two-way fixed effects regressions that include leads and lags of the treatment. We show that in settings with variation in treatment timing across units, the coefficient on a given lead or lag can be contaminated by effects from other periods, and apparent pretrends can arise solely from treatment effects heterogeneity. We propose an alternative estimator that is free of contamination, and illustrate the relative shortcomings of two-way fixed effects regressions with leads and lags through an empirical application.},

  abstract = {Using the findings of the 1999 Survey of Innovation in the Canadian manufacturing sector, we analyse the impediments, i.e. the problems and obstacles, that firms in the sector face when they innovate. In particular, we assess the factors which inhibit innovation, especially with regard to by small and medium enterprises (SMEs). First we try to establish the relationship between the impediments to innovation and various firm characteristics. Then we assess whether these impediments actually prevent firms from innovating or whether firms are able to overcome them. We find that the perception of impediments to innovation vary according to firm characteristics. For example, large firms are more likely to report the high cost of developing innovation and organizational rigidities as impediments than small firms. However, they seem to have less difficulty with regard to financing innovation projects compared to SMEs. Our results also show that firms seem to be able to overcome most of the obstacles to innovation. Therefore, the impediments featured in innovation survey(s) should not be interpreted as impenetrable barriers that prevent innovation. The sole exception is organizational rigidities. Firms facing organizational rigidities are less likely to become innovative, whether they are small, medium, or large. From our results, we conclude that small firms do not face particular impediments which prevent them from becoming innovative.},

According to their claims, the new theory is superior to the classical Downsian proximity model. Such a conclusion, however, is not tenable. First, it fails to take proper account of the lower falsifiability of the directional model. Second, it rests on empirical analyses that do not test the two theories on the predictions they actually make. Both are theories of individual choice, which implies intrapersonal comparisons of utility. Prior tests, however, have predominantly taken the form of interpersonal comparisons. A reanalysis based on the proper type of comparison yields an outcome diametrically opposed to that previously obtained. It also reveals an eccentricity effect that largely accounts for the apparent success of the directional model.},

A number of scholars argue that the pattern is rooted in cross-sectional effects and have found apparent evidence of such effects. However, most of these studies do not take into account the possibility that economic perceptions are themselves structured by vote choice, which poses potentially serious implications. We begin to address this endogeneity, focusing specifically on Lewis-Beck's (1988) analysis of economic voting. The results suggest that the cross-sectional effects of the economy on vote choice have been substantially overstated.},

  abstract = {Vehicle taxes and purchase subsidies have been used frequently to provide incentives for electric vehicle adoption. To examine the role of the incentives in reducing total ownership costs of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), increasing BEV sales, and obtaining environmental benefits from switching to BEVs, we carry out cost‚Äìbenefit analyses and ordinary least square regressions. We study 10 pairs of BEVs and their internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) counterparts across 28 European countries from 2012 to 2014. The results show that, under the incentive schemes, the costs reduced by switching to large BEVs from their ICEV counterparts are larger than the costs reduced by switching to small BEVs from their ICEV counterparts. Owing to the cost-reduction effect, a 10\% increase of the total tax incentive leads to an increase in the sales share of BEVs by around 3\% on average. Finally, we find that it is still costly to use the tax incentives to reduce CO2 emissions and other environmental externalities through transport electrification, despite recent improvements in greening electricity generation and lowering battery costs.},

Myths also are constructed by modern Western peoples in the arena of public policy, where they direct attention away from equally valued but contradictory societal principles. Agencies created to implement policies also construct myths. Policy myths and their related organizational myths are constructed at those points where the implementing agency is most vulnerable: around actions undertaken to achieve verboten goals-those goals that are publicly unspeakable because there is no explicit public consensus underlying them. Policy myths, in other words, fill silences in discourse about public policy matters. Yet these myths also facilitate the tacit understanding of and communication about verboten goals. These points are illustrated in a case analysis of the Israel Corporation of Community Centers, an agency created to implement national social policies.},

Using Canadian panel data for 1988-90, I compare estimates based on the traditional U.S. methodology with those based on samples of "low-wage" workers exclusively. The results would appear to vindicate the critics: The minimum wage effect from the latter approach is virtually zero. Yet, estimates from different subgroups of low-wage workers indicate that there is a significant disemployment effect for those with longer low-wage employment histories. This highlights the heterogeneity within low-wage workers and the importance of carefully defining the target group not solely based on workers' wages.},
