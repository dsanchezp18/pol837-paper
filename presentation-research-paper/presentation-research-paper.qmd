# Introduction

- Ideally, voters can adequately assess the performance of elected officials to hold them accountable at the ballot box.

- However, evaluations of political performance can be influenced by factors unrelated to politician performance [@healy_etal10; @healy_malhotra10; @achen_bartels17].

- I investigate whether transient temperature changes affect presidential approval in Ecuador.

- Results show that a 1°C increase in maximum temperature leads to a 1.1 to 2.0 percentage points decrease in the likelihood of presidential approval. 

::: {.notes}
- The literature suggests that efficient systems of retrospective voting can lead to greater democratic accountability and efficient political outcomes

- Factors include cognitive bias, recency bias, heuristics, party cues, among others. 

- Shark attacks, draughts, football matches, among others.

# Theoretical framework

- @schwarz_clore83 and @bower81 show that, when induced negative moods, individuals are more likely to search for outside factors which justify their feelings. 

- A "higher than normal" temperature would then induce a negative mood, leading to citizens looking for reasons to justify their feelings of discontent. 

- Existing research has found significant effects of weather on behaviour [@barrington-leigh_behzadnejad17;@lignier_etal23;@keller_etal05;@kampfer_mutz13].

### Hypothesis
Citizens will be more likely to disapprove of the president on days with higher temperatures.
:::

::: {.notes}
- These are studies in psychology which set the stage for how mood can affect how people behave in a variety of settings. 

- The idea is that, if people are in a bad mood, they are more likely to remember negative events and attribute them to the source of their mood.

- @bower81 shows that individuals are more likely to remember unfavorable events when in a negative mood.

# Empirical strategy

## Data {.smaller}

- Global daily gridded temperature data from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center [-@NOAADatasets].

- Collects temperature of 50x50 km grids across the world mapped to Ecuadorian municipalities (cantons).

. . .

![Average daily temperature for 2023, cantons map](/figures/temperature_map.jpg)

:::{.notes}

- While daily weather data would typically be available from weather stations, the data is not available for Ecuador, which is why I use data from satellite observations. 

- Data collected for grids in the whole world, but I focus on Ecuador. 

- The data is available at a 0.5° x 0.5° resolution, which is approximately 50 km x 50 km at the equator.

- I compute weighted averages for every canton in Ecuador, assigning weights based on canton boundaries
:::

## Data: The AmericasBarometer Survey {.smaller}

- Biennial public opinion survey conducted in Ecuador since 2004 [@ABEcuadorMerged].

- I use a pooled cross-section of individuals from 2008 to 2023.

- Daily weather data is joined with the survey by interview date and canton of the survey respondent.

. . .

![AmericasBarometer Interview Dates](/figures/interview_dates_barchart.png)

## Identification strategy {.smaller}

- I use fixed effects logistic regression to estimate presidential popularity functions:

. . .

$$  \text{approval}_{ijt} = \alpha + \tau_t + \theta_j + \beta \ \text{temp}_{jt} + \mathbb{X'}_{ijt} \ \gamma + u_{ijt}
$$

- $\text{approval}_{ijt}$ is a binary indicator of approval by respondent $i$ in canton $j$ on day $t$.

- $\tau_t$ and $\theta_j$ are day and canton fixed effects, $\text{temp}_{jt}$ is a daily temperature measure in canton $j$ on day $t$, and $\mathbb{X'}_{ijt}$ is a vector of control variables for presidential approval. 

- Short-term temperature changes can be seen as random and thus unrelated to variables that affect presidential approval.

- $\hat{\beta}$ is consistent and measures the causal effect of temperature on presidential approval.

- Clustered standard errors at the canton level. 

:::{.notes}
- The fixed effects control for time-invariant characteristics of cantons and time-varying characteristics of days.

- The control variables include demographic, economic and political behaviour characteristics of the respondent. While my design would technically allow me to not include these controls, I do so to increase the precision of my estimates, and test for potential confounding effects.

- Perform robustness checks by running regressions with different clustering levels.

# Results

## Baseline results {.smaller}

- Four specifications with no controls other than fixed effects.

- Minimum temperature only, maximum temperature only, average temperature (mean of min and max), and both temperatures with daily precipitation. 

- Statistically significant and negative effect of **maximum temperature**.

- Average marginal effect (AME) of **-1.1%**.

. . . 

![Coefficient plot of average partial effects of baseline specifications](/figures/model_plot_baseline.jpg)

:::{.notes}

- The effect of minimum temperature is not statistically significant.

- Precipitation is not statistically significant either.

- Logistic regression gives coefficients which are not interpretable, so what I'm plotting are average marginal effects.

- These give you interpretable results, such as the ones you'd get from a linear probability model, however, they are only average effects for the sample. 

- The negative and statistically significant effect of maximum temperature of 1.1% means that respondents are 1.1% less likely to approve of the president on days with higher temperatures.
:::

## Models with controls {.smaller}

- The same four specifications with controls for respondent characteristics.

- Statistically significant and negative effect of **maximum temperature**; AME of **-2%**.

. . .

![Coefficient plot of average partial effects of specifications with controls](/figures/logit_marginal_effects_controls.jpg)

:::{.notes}
- Again, neither minimum temperature or precipitation are statistically significant.

- Note how my average marginal effects do change after controlling for respondent characteristics. This is evidence against the randomness of temperature, but I'll discuss that in a few more minutes.

- The 2.2% effect of maximum temperature means that respondents are 2.2% less likely to approve of the president on days with higher temperatures.

- Including a natural logarithm transformation is equivalent to consider percentage increases of temperature, meaning that the effect of temperature is non-linear: as temperature increases, the effect on presidential approval increases faster. Your mood might make you disapprove more of the president at 25°C than at 20°C, but even more at 30°C.

# Conclusion

- Important to consider the implications of weather for retrospective voting, especially for developing countries. 

- Survey respondents are 1.1 to 2.0% less likely to approve of the president after 1\degree C increase in maximum temperature.

- The evidence supports the theory of poor retrospective voters due to mood-induced attribution errors. 

- The CPC weather data could be subject to measurement error, which would downward bias my estimates.

:::{.notes}

- A negative mood induced by higher temperatures could first lead to a negative attitude to members in Congress, which could extend to a positive attitude towards the president.

- In this case, I am not estimating the direct effect of weather on mood, but the indirect effect of weather on presidential approval through mood.

# Appendices

## Documented weather effects

- Existing research has found significant effects of weather on self-reported well-being and life satisfaction [@barrington-leigh08;@barrington-leigh_behzadnejad17;@lignier_etal23;@keller_etal05;@kampfer_mutz13;@connolly13].

- Individuals are affected by **unpleasant weather**, which is highly dependent on the regional and seasonal context. 

- In some cases, effects are significant though small and not robust [@schmiedeberg_schroder14;@lucas_lawless13]. 

- @bassi19 also proposes that bad weather negatively impacts individuals' mood, finding that individuals are less likely to vote by risky candidates when faced with bad weather.

- @feddersen_etal16 and @quijano-ruiz23 find small negative effects of temperature changes on self-rated health; @li_etal20 and @mullins_white19 find significant impacts on mental health. 

- @deller_michels22 find that rain impacts the way that managers evaluate subordinates and @li_patel21 find that students are only marginally sensitive to higher temperatures during exams. 

:::{.notes}

- For instance, papers which find effects in Canada find that individuals are negatively to be affected by cold weather. In Australia, the opposite is true.

## Descriptive Statistics {.smaller .scrollable}

{{< include /data/output/descriptive_statistics.md >}}

## Explained variable: presidential approval {.smaller}

- The AmericasBarometer asks a slight variation of the common Gallup poll question [@berlemann_enkelmann14a], with a 5-point scale, five being full disapproval.

- Dichotomized the variable to a binary indicator of approval, grouping responses of 1 and 2 into approval and 0 otherwise.

:::

## Treatment: daily temperature

- I observe daily maximum and minimum temperature for cantons in the interview dates of the AB.

:::{.notes}
- No notable upward or downward trend in temperature over the years.

- Some periods show higher temperatures than others, but no clear pattern.

- Spread between maximum and minimum temperatures is consistent over the years.
