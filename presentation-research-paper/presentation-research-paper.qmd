# Introduction

- Ideally, voters can adequately assess the performance of elected officials to hold them accountable at the ballot box.

- However, evaluations of political performance can be influenced by factors unrelated to politican performance [@healy_etal10; @healy_malhotra10; @achen_bartels17]

- I investigate whether transient temperature changes affect presidential approval in Ecuador.

- Results show that a 1°C increase in maximum temperature leads to a **1.9 - 2.2 p.p.** decrease in the likelihood of presidential approval. 

::: {.notes}
- The literature suggests that efficient systems of retrospective voting can lead to greater democratic accountability and efficient political outcomes

- Factors include cognitive bias, recency bias, heuristics, party cues, among others. 

- Shark attacks, draughts, football matches, among others.

# Theoretical framework

- @schwarz_clore83 show that, when induced negative moods, individuals are more likely to search for outside factors which justify their feelings. 

- A "higher than normal" temperature would then induce a negative mood, leading to citizens looking for reasons to justify their feelings of discontent. 

- @bower81 show that individuals are more likely to remember negative events when in a negative mood.

### Hypothesis
Respondents who had their survey on days with higher temperatures are less likely to approve of the president.
:::

::: {.notes}
- These are studies in psychology which set the stage for how mood can affect how people behave in a variety of settings. 

- The idea is that, if people are in a bad mood, they are more likely to remember negative events and attribute them to the source of their mood.

# Documented weather effects

- Existing research has found significant effects of weather on self-reported well-being and life satisfaction [@barrington-leigh08;@barrington-leigh_behzadnejad17;@lignier_etal23;@keller_etal05;@kampfer_mutz13;@connolly13] 

- In some cases, effects are significant though small and not robust [@schmiedeberg_schroder14;@lucas_lawless13]. 

- @feddersen_etal16 and @quijano-ruiz23 find small negative effects of temperature changes on self-rated health; @li_etal20 and @mullins_white19 find significant impacts on mental health. 

- @deller_michels22 find that rain impacts the way that managers evaluate subordinates and @li_patel21 find that students are only marginally sensitive to higher temperatures during exams. 

# Empirical strategy

## Data {.smaller}

- Global daily gridded temperature data from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center [-@NOAADatasets].

- Collects temperature of 50x50 km grids across the world mapped to Ecuadorian municipalities (cantons).

. . .

:::{.notes}

- While daily weather data would typically be available from weather stations, the data is not available for Ecuador, which is why I use data from satellite observations. 

- Data collected for grids in the whole world, but I focus on Ecuador. 

- The data is available at a 0.5° x 0.5° resolution, which is approximately 50 km x 50 km at the equator.

- I compute weighted averages for every canton in Ecuador, assigning weights based on canton boundaries

## Data: The AmericasBarometer Survey {.smaller}

- Biennial public opinion survey conducted in Ecuador since 2004 surveying 1,500 - 3,000 individuals across 50-60 cantons every year [@ABEcuadorMerged].

- Daily weather data is joined with the survey by interview date, observed since 2008 wave, and canton of the survey respondent.

. . .

## Identification strategy

- I use fixed effects logistic regression to estimate presidential popularity functions:

. . .

$$  \text{approval}_{ijt} = \alpha + \tau_t + \theta_j + \beta \ \text{temp}_{jt} + \mathbb{X'}_{ijt} \ \gamma + u_{ijt}
$$

- $\text{approval}_{ijt}$ is a binary indicator of approval by respondent $i$ in canton $j$ on day $t$.

- $\tau_t$ and $\theta_j$ are day and canton fixed effects, $\text{temp}_{jt}$ is a daily temperature measure in canton $j$ on day $t$, and $\mathbb{X'}_{ijt}$ is a vector of control variables for presidential approval. 

- Short-term temperature changes can been seen as random and thus unrelated to variables that affect presidential approval.

- $\hat{\beta}$ is consistent and measures the causal effect of temperature on presidential approval.

## Explained variable: presidential approval {.smaller}

- The AmericasBaromter asks a slight variation of the common Gallup poll question [@berlemann_enkelmann14a], with a 5-point scale (5 being full disapproval).

- Dichotomized the variable to a binary indicator of approval, grouping responses of 1 and 2 into approval and 0 otherwise.

- "Do you approve or disapprove of the way [name of the president] is handling his job as president?"
:::

## Treatment: daily temperature

- I observe daily maximum and minimum temperature for cantons in the interview dates of the AB.

. . .

![Monthly mean temperatures 2008 - 2023](/figures/ecuador_monthly_mean_temps_fig.jpg)

:::{.notes}
- No notable upward or downward trend in temperature over the years.

- Some periods show higher temperatures than others, but no clear pattern.

- Spread between maximum and minimum temperatures is consistent over the years.
