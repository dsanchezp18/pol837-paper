# Notes

- Political scientists have studied how voters evaluate politicians' performance, and how this evaluation affects their vote choice.

- It has been documented how in many cases "correct" attributions of responsibility can lead to more "efficient" political outcomes, which improve the quality of democratic governance.

- However, it has also been noted that voters can be biased in their attributions of responsibility, which can be harmful for political accountability, creating inefficient incentives for politicians.

- Voters taking into account irrelevant information, or blaming politicians for irrelevant events, can *damage the incentivizing function of retrospective voting*.

- A heuristic, or heuristic technique, is any approach to problem solving or self-discovery that employs a practical method that is not guaranteed to be optimal, perfect, or rational, but is nevertheless sufficient for reaching an immediate, short-term goal or approximation.

- The "causal" mechanism is emotional & physical discomfort due to weather, causing people to misattribute their discomfort to a politician, and thus evaluate them negatively. 
    - Unsure if the outcome will be the negative evaluation of the politician, or the voting decision, or something else.
    - Also unsure if the voter is aware of the misattribution, or if it is subconscious.
    - Unsure if the voter directly blames the politician of the heat (due to an environmental concern?) or they are simply in a bad mood and thus evaluate any politician negatively. How to measure this?

- If I want to focus on performance models, what should my dependent variables be? 
    - Performance ratings?
    - Economic perceptions?

- What kind of literature tells me what regressors/covariates to have?
    - *Presidential approval literature*?
    - *Economic voting literature*?
    - *Governing party literature*?

- Does focusing on a variety of dependent variables make sense, or is it too broad, making the paper too hard to handle? 
    - I could focus on presidential approval ratings, local government, trust in institutions, etc.
